Alex_Freeland_2020_09_18_01_50_12_449.wav	Super OK, so first thing I want to talk about is the punctuate server for Memo. So the idea is is that we give it some text. Or, Well, you know we give it some text which has been stripped of all punctuation and capital letters, and it automatically figures out where the punctuation goes. I won't go into too much detail in how we like achieve this in C# and kotlin because I'm going to assume that you can like look through my code and figure it out yourself. Yeah, I'm just going to talk about like. The architecture, like all the different bits which and how they fit together rather than actually line by line stuff. So yeah, the way it works is obviously we've got like big machine learning process. To do that, we do that through a Python script which you can find in TFS, so it's got its own separate repo which is in here Memo Python script. And the way this works is we've got a VM in Azure which is running on quite a high tier which is continually running. And when it gets sent request that executes this particular bit of Python code. Yeah, yeah, you can still figure out what it's roughly what it's doing. But yeah, I've got a VM with an exposed port which is doing this, which takes. Which takes this sentence. Does a bunch of machine learning AI stuff gives us an output so the downsides of doing it like this and the things which we want to look at at some point in the future? Are first of all security. So we're doing it on a totally exposed port when we try to put a file on it a few weeks ago. So that would only allow it that, like the Memo server will be able to talk to it and possibly our IPS as well. So like if you're part of the volume VPN, or if you're one of our Azure things, then the server fell over pretty quickly. So at the moment, so long as you've got the address when this is hosted then anybody can ping the server. So at some point we need to think about how we're going to do that. The other issue I've got is because it's machine learning stuff. We need quite a powerful VM to run it, so your standard like GPUs and processing power. But because it's punctuation it needs to happen as quickly as possible. And so because of that, we can't really wait for like a GP for like Azure's autoscaling to kick in. So it just has to sit at the high level. So yeah, possibly there's some clever stuff we can do in the future where if nobody is using Memo then we put it down to a lower tier and as soon as somebody starts a session then we turn it on, put it back to high one. But these are like problems to look at in the future when we're actually working on this project. An yeah as to as far as the actual code goes, it's fairly simple. It's all in this in its dot PY file, which isn't fantastic. But yeah, it's sort of mostly copied from an Azure functions example. And yeah, with like coouple of bits added to call the libraries we want. I probably should have asked this a little while ago, but how I'm familiar with the Python stuff Kalum? Have you done like Azure functions in Python or? Cool, OK so I don't need to go through this then yeah, I mean it's all commented. Actually, if you run into any problems on on this particular thing, Joe might be the person to go to just be cause he was the one who wrote it in the first place. And then if you want the actual machine learning stuff, then that was the work of Judith so. Yep, that'll be good. So you can find it on Azure. I don't think. Well I don't have access to it, but there's just a VM in one of the probably in the Memo resource group, which will. I have looked. Other way you can look of course is just go into the Memo code base and there will be. There's like a separate library for calling this. Separate library? Separate like project calling it. Yeah, that's the word. Cool. So it goes through the server so. Yeah, it's a slightly difficult process because the user can add punctuation. Can add their own custom punctuation in Memo so. So the user can say like, so we get something back to the text to speech. And we stripped all the punctuation out of it and then we check the list of words which the user might have added? So for example, they might have said full stop or something. Then we added the full stop and then we post that new version to our server and then we carefully put that into the punctuation engine, get the result back, compare the two lists of punctuation. So what the user put in and what the punctuation engine wants and figure out where things are supposed to go. And because we've got like punctuation being added in a few different places and I should also say that we're not cutting out some punctuation which text to speech give us. So if someone says 100% we're leaving in the percent symbol. So we've got punctuation being added in three different ways, which, as you might expect, is a massive pain to deal with. Not to mention that a lot. This is happening in like multithreaded process is this took a lot of thought to get working. But yeah, it's been cool, but basically the flow is it goes from the app to the server, to the VM, back to the server, back to the app. Cool, OK so that's why I wanted to talk about on the Memo punctuate. I mean like you can look at examples of how VMS working like Microsoft having some good documentation. Surprisingly, I can link. I'll probably put it in the handover notes which explains what all these functions are doing. All these files are, I mean. A lot of them I've just been copied and pasted over. An important one is probably requirements .txt, where you like specify all the tools you need. But before we see this before, cool next one I want to talk about is the teams bot in Memo so. So yeah, this is what actually writes the post, which says had a meeting today and like says the date and tags, people and all that stuff. Um, and you can get to that. How, yeah, there we go. If you go drop down and then to the old before git repo. And we've got a few different tools in here, so we've got speech metrics tool which is built in WPF, which is basically because it was borrowed, borrowed from some example on the Internet, which just like analyzes a bit of text, then calculates the word error rate and some other statistics. You don't need to know that I don't think we're using it anymore, but just in case Marc Goes, Oh well, what happened to the old word error rate tool? I mean, it might be useful at the moment because Judith talking quite a lot about that sort of thing. When it comes to the the new bot which have been making. So that's where it is if you need it. I mean, I'd be surprised you did, so I wouldn't even bother like looking through the code. But the teams bot what one do I want. OK, so have you. So the point you've written in teams? Have you made it post to teams? What have you done with it? Yep. OK, yeah. Oh cool, OK. So are you using the Microsoft bot framework? Or are you doing it differently? Oh cool, well in that case you should be familiar with this because that is exactly what this is. This is a super difficult bot framework project with like a few little extra bits for HSBC. I mean the thing about working with the bot framework is that the states are like slightly different to what we used to with web apps like. It's kind of difficult to invoke the Bot. You can't just like call an arbitrary function. Which that set something in the bot. But if you're comfortable with that then I don't need to talk about it too much. You mean this line here? Yeah, cool. Yeah, I'm OK, a few. I'll go through a few things about it anyway just because I don't know we spent a bunch of time on this. It's a project where we never really found a very elegant solution to the art to it, because we need to be able to send. Information like sort of freely between our server and the bot and the bot's not really designed for that because the bot just exists, to like reply to events. So the bot lives on the channel when the channel sends an event than the bots starts doing something. So eventually we use this Microsoft Library which triggers events. There's this. There's code in Memo which you've probably have seen, which you've probably seen at this point, which sends an object with these things, and it's can I scroll down a bit. Yeah, yeah it's better code which sounds like these bit things. It gets passed through to. Through the team bot and it writes the message and. When the teams bot first gets added to a channel, it adds that information to like a secure place in Azure. So I think it's a blob storage where it just sticks a whole bunch of information about the channel. Basically all the stuff it needs to send a message there and then our server for Fruut or Memo. Retrieves that data from the same storage place, which then allows it to send messages to the bot so that bots can put messages into teams. So I mean it's fairly easy to figure out who work with this a bit before, so that should be pretty good. One thing we found is that you can put pretty much arbitrary HTML into teams. I mean you can't do anything stupid like you can't put scripts, tags or whatever, but if you want images, you can do it. If you want formatting like online HTML formatting, you can do it. It's not that dissimilar to if you've ever written like HTML emails, so you can't have separate CSS class CSS file. You have to like press it all into one file. Yeah, and then you've got like your standard hey HTML formatting. So like your H1 through H6 in your italic bold tags, whatever, they don't get respected very well by teams, so it's better to use your own styles where you can. Yeah, we'll just do a bit of experimentation. See what H1 through H6 do because they're not like descending order of size like everyone else makes them but. Oh Super. Yeah, but that's all that the message that we're passing his team says is just a bit of HTML. I mean, I can dig one up, but you can look yourself. It's a table with some formatting. It's got a couple of bits of text with various bits of formatting. I think there's some talk at the moment about changing them to look slightly differently. But yeah, we'll just see how that one goes. And the way the actual HTML is written is very similar to how we do emails. So we've got a blank template and then with a bunch of like placeholders and we replace the placeholders with users names and so on. One more thing to mention, which you've probably already seen when writing your part of the bot is. When you want to tag a user, you put them in like at tags and you put their name and sometimes depending on the content of the team, you'd need to add a bit more metadata, but it starts with a tags menu, then their full name and sometimes you specify like user ID. And yeah, that's right. Yeah, I know so you can just look at my C# code and you'll find it because it's in Fruut and Memo. Cool, so that's the team bot. I think that'll be absolutely fine for you, um, so the other service which I'm maintaining is in notepad plus plus I think. Yeah, so this is the. Python in Fruut and what this does is we did it a couple of sprints ago, right? It's the one where it strips actions to make it a bit more simple than they are. So if it's like action for Alex to book a meeting this Friday, it will like get rid of most of the words that you say. Alex book a meeting and then we use that for for the team's message and for the message in. Yeah, the message in the app as well and also emails. So it's just like a little way of simplifying things a bit. It works quite nicely. So because the VM approach didn't work very well and wasn't quite wasn't successful for this project. Instead I'm doing a flask app and so we've got a flask app hosted in Azure. Flask is just like I hate to say this. It's basically dot. NET Framework for Python. I mean it's a similar sort of thing. It's a library which does web hosting. It works beautifully well Azure. Really keen on it at the moment and it's such a nice developer cycle because it runs incredibly quickly. Setup is very is almost instant. Publishing is very, very fast. It's really a pleasure to work with. I cannot emphasize how good flask is. I mean it's it makes the whole dot NET Framework Visual Studio look incredibly outdated. But yeah, anyway, enough about my language preferences, so there's a bunch of good tutorials on Microsoft on the flask which I've put in my hand over notes. Long and short of it is when you've been doing Python. Have you done virtual environments? Oh super well, I don't need spoke about that too much. So basically you create a virtual environment for your flask project, which means that you can use separate libraries on that to what you have everywhere else on your computer. So you do need to reinstall everything but you install the exact versions you want. They go into requirements .txt file. Up yeah, when you publish the app to Azure it automatically installs everything you put in here. So these real Python libraries, right? Well, more specifically, their all arguments to PIP. Which I'm sure you've used. If you've touched Python at all, so these are all just things to installs AllenNLP's the important one along with pytorch I guess. Yeah, because that handles the machine learning which Judith wants to put in the rest of them are just a flask default and not particularly important. So you don't probably need to touch them. Yeah, so compared to the Memo punctuate server. This is still machine learning stuff, but it also doesn't require that much processing power like this is running on the cheapest available flasks here, which isn't free and runs pretty much instantly almost every time, even though it's calling some pretty heavy stuff. So that's really nice. Yeah, so it's the file is basically what it looks like you can figure it out yourself. It's got simple routing calls the function so this is exposing an end point which is like flask URL, forward slash, simplify, and then it's asking for a query string. And yeah, you'll go from there that you can do all that AllenNLP stuff and. Turns of phrase. The really cool thing about flask is you can return anything well, you just call returning your function and that will be the HTML which gets sent back to request. So if you wanted to do a website in it rather than doing returning a string, you'll just return your return like tags and stuff. Here all we need to do is just return the string you want and then we can use that straight away as an argument. We can use that straight away from the C# from our server so it will call slash simplify. Simplify is just a function which returns a string and we don't need to do any more formatting on it at all, which is very very nice. Yeah, so the actual app itself is really simple like you can read through it and figure it out pretty quickly. It loads a model goes from there. In terms of what else is in the project that is about it. So we've got. Yeah, it's a list of libraries. It's a virtual environment. It's the actual Python which runs all the code. Yeah, and it's and it's. This is in the Fruut repo on Microsoft Teams. Um not on Microsoft Teams, on TFS so it should be pretty easy for you get and have a look through. Um? Yeah, so that's about it for this Python library. I wouldn't mind having it if you have some down time, which I know you never, ever do. But if you do have the chance, possibly have a look at moving the punctuate stuff over to flask just because it works a lot better and you get things like security for free. Cool, so those were the things I want to talk about. Those are the services which I'm supporting or I've built and. Are really being cared for anymore. They're all in a slightly awkward place where or when they were done on very short time requirements, so they're mostly just Microsoft defaults. With enough changes to make it work in our one case, and like all the tutorial comments left in, so there'd be some sort of reference for the future. I mean, I perfectionist in me wants to go back and look at them, but you know the way we do projects and two week sprints they never get touched again. But it's good to know where they are in case they break and you can check when they go down. Obviously they're all international. I think they're all in the HSBC or they're all in the Fruut. With the memo resource groups. So yeah, that should be pretty good. So. So hang on the action cleaning is only for Fruut, Yeah? The punctuation stuff is only for Memo for whatever reason they've ended up with two completely different ways of hosting them in Python, but. No, we're not. We're just doing the punctuation stuff. Yeah again, I mean this is decision which is being made. I think it would be fairly it be fairly easy, to port the action stuff from Fruut to Memo. Porting the punctuation stuff from Memo to Fruut would be a bit of a headache. So taking this stuff here, so actually simplification to Memo would be pretty easy. The stuff where we're redoing the punctuation in Memo would be difficult to bring to Fruut just because it's first of all. It's a massive headache, and there's been enough changes between Memo and Fruut that it would just be difficult to do. Oh yeah, totally. I mean, we could absolutely have another function here add a few more Python libraries. Even like do it. Yeah, we can easily use ones have both. There might be then some issues about billing costs the different projects, but you know if it's saving the company money then I'm not sure. I don't think Benoit will turn you down on it. Yeah, I'll book in another session to talk through some of the Kotlin stuff. I mean, you know most of it's someone who's experienced this. You are in development. You can just look at the figure out, but there's just a few like weird Android specific things which don't really occur. In any of the other languages or libraries we use, but I want to talk through, so I'll book another session for that. Yep, and that's about it. So yeah, thanks for listening to me, rambling on about my project for for half an hour. Um I do I put it in the handover notes and it's also? Here. It's really, really simple, like I think I went from not knowing anything about flask to having something running in Azure in like half an hour and then half an hour later. I had the machine learning stuff running perfectly. I mean it works really nicely. Yeah, Yep. Yeah, I mean you have to use your command line a bit more than usual. Use like Azure Command line prompt. You know we software developers. We love that sort of thing. Cool. Perfect Yeah but yeah, I would recommend just like going through this and you'll see wow that was really easy. Well hopefully yeah. Yep. No problem at all. No problem and thanks, Yeah but yeah yeah bye. Already. OK. Yep. Yeah, thanks man you too. Hi.
Alison_Houston_2020_09_04_08_20_10.wav	Hi Brian, how are you? Good, Thanks. Glad it's Friday. As always. Hi Marc. Oh no! How, how could that happen? Not a lot, Joe? From our team. Yeah, Leanne popped in. Thanks. Actually when I got home from the office or not immediately but later on in the evening I had a sneezing fit. And like a runny nose and I thought I was coming down with something but then it disappeared. So I don't know. Maybe it's maybe it's the office is like got dust or something in it I don't know. Yeah, 'cause it hasn't been lived in really for for awhile so I don't know. Oh God. Oh yeah, yeah, let's hope anyway. No. Hi Paulo. Shall I go first? OK, um so Judith um, she's going to be finishing finishing off some Bee work that she was doing yesterday, adding some new content, and then she's got some planning to do around fruut on the transcription data model. And, um, so Benoit mentioned yesterday about sometimes when he was doing fruut demos. The transcriptions still weren't coming back correctly, so she's looking into that. See if she can recreate some bugs and see if she can fix them. Sheamus is continuing what finishing off his utterance, similarities stuff ready for Bryn to work on when he comes back and then he's going on his text summarization, R&D piece, and for me, um, it's American Red Cross. I see there still doing lots of testing on it. We've got nearly 900 questions that they asked yesterday, um, so look through some of those, and I'm going to write up a document. I had a meeting with Benoit yesterday about work that. Data models can do for R&D stuff, and when we're a little bit quiet, so I'm going to write up the notes. With that, we've got like a go to document. And that's it. From our team. Anybody else want to go? Yeah. I do. Yes. And you see you later. Bye.
Alison_Houston_2020_09_07_08_21_37_633.wav	OK, um so Judith is well she both of us actually have got the word error rate process review meeting today. She has got an issue on be something's not working, so she needs to look into that. She has just the fruit. Sprint is starting. She's got to implement a date phrase entity that she was working on. There's lots of bits and pieces today and once a weekly report is done. She needs to check over that. That's the Lucy report. Excuse me, sorry Seamus, he's just going to be optimizing the script for the sentence similarity work for Brynn. And then going back onto his text summarization work and for me I've got the American Red Cross model monitoring and there still are asked a lot of questions on Friday, so I've got to go through. That will probably take up most of my day. And that's it from us. Have a good day, bye.
Alison_Houston_2020_09_24_08_00_56_863.wav	Morning. Yeah, yeah, she's fine now. Thank well not fine, but she's getting there. She had a really badly infected wound. Um, so she's on a stronger course of antibiotics, but um, she's also. They were worried about her heart because her heart keeps going into atrial fibrillation, is it? Yeah, she had to be on monitors and oh, it was a scary day. But she was back home last night and yeah, she's not too bad this morning. Yeah, thank you. It was, yeah, really scary anyway. Hopefully she's on the mend. So yeah, I'm OK. Do you want to go first? Judith. OK. Yep, OK. Yep, OK. OK. OK, OK, I'm you've got it too. Was it 13% word error rate? 12% now, OK, that's good. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely fair enough. Yeah, OK. OK, OK, I'm so Seamus. How's your day looking? OK. Yeah, it's OK. So set yourself a little meeting. Maybe to have a catch up on that. OK, OK, I'm was there. Anything more said on the Bell Canada project. Nothing yesterday no. No, there was nothing more in the conversation. Thread. From Benoit, just wondered if he caught up with you too at all anymore on that. OK um. Maybe we'll just leave that for now. I don't know what his decision is going to be on that, but I'm sure he'll tell us at some point. OK, OK um so for me. I don't think there's much to do on American Red Cross because I think by the looks that they they kind of stopped doing anymore testing on it. I know I've gotta catch up with the client and Kim tomorrow about it, so that's probably the results of all there. Testing they did so for me. I will probably finish one last of my QBox videos and get some of those sent over to Ray. See if he can put any of them onto YouTube and then I. Not sure I might I might carry on with them bee as I said Before, I never got around to doing anymore of it, but I'm like just carry on where you left off, Judith. Yeah, unless anything else comes up. Oh do we OK? OK, oh inside this morning 11:00 o'clock. OK, OK, I'll note that down for both of us as well. OK, anything else from anybody? No all good. OK guys, have a good day and I will speak to you later. K bye.
Asiri_Fernando_2020_09_07_08_21_37_633.wav	Right? Visitors. Yep. So. Intuit's painful. It's continuation this week. Joe be Joe's task was not quite done yet, so so I mean it has been handed over to Chanaka to. Work on that task. So because Joe is on holiday and as well does not know he's back. I think he's going to work on BP. LO. Apart from that, you know in the task half finishing with the other developers they are going to keep away for for cycle of a testing an have a few bugs coming in so they are working all those bugs.
Asiri_Fernando_2020_09_10_08_23_24_332.wav	Should I go next? Alright, so Intuit Sprint four stories are finishing off today, so integration testing did we start tomorrow. So today we we also did another live delivery on Intrado Web Inasa. So it was a fix. So Shalinda, Shalinda was working on that. And we'll be starting integration testing tomorrow. Yeah, that's it. Mark, you go next. Yeah. Yeah, catch you later, bye.
Benoit_Alvarez_2020_09_09_08_31_45_203.wav	Hello guys. You OK? Sorry so sorry Paolo. Are we still working on American Red Cross? OK. OK OK cool and I'm talking about disambiguations and dialogues and so on. Couple of weeks back I sent some information to Kym for BBC on. Gosh, I want to say it is called. I don't remember what it's called. I give me a second. I will find it. My my Teams is not open properly. I have no idea. OK, it's gonna take me a bit of time but it's as your bot framework, but it's a specific component of your bot framework. To look into. And any any area where they have been doing a lot of work. Microsoft run dialogue management and so on, so it's a bit more, you know, more friendly. That's what we have to start with. And, also, Microsoft is working a lot in what they call unstructured dialogues, meaning. I don't have all the details because I didn't watch all the informations, but it's in beta on me, but it's something where you have to be less strict about your dialogue, as as far as I understand an, it's it's a bit more clever so it's a lot less linear has that come to you at all has that. Made its way to you. Have you heard of it? Let me yeah. OK OK I have the name now it's called bot framework composer. Yeah, and this has been released for quite quite a while. You have a few YouTube videos, so let me let me share those things. I don't, you know. I'm. This is really once. We have a little bit more bandwidth. This is something we need to work on. This type of cycle functions. Because I think it will help massively in dialogue management. It will help massively in, you know future proofing our framework because a weak point is dialogues on our framework, we know, but we don't want to build another dialogue view our own dialogue management. But it seems Microsoft has something very solid there. Or at least are working on something. So let me send you a few links. I don't understand why it's not making you aware. That's a little bit surprising I guess. So I will send you this link. I will send you a couple of YouTube video. As well. About I think one of the YouTube video it's about composer itself, another one it's about a beta feature. They have just released. OK, Alright so I sent you all that. I, I think Mark, I think you have a point here. You know communications now has to go through our relationship managers. So just to be super clear for everybody to to be aware relationship manager for QBox is Leanne, relationship manager for Fruut is Sandra. OK.
Benoit_Alvarez_2020_09_18_08_22_45_358.wav	Did she get it? Exactly. Exactly I love you know you just I mean by I guess it's there but I just wanted to email it. I said no, you have to bring it. I are you ******* kidding me and you have to queue. Because it's people that the rest of the desk an any. Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, it's really clever. It's it's the people that educate your kids. It's really scary. Anyway, anyway, you'll be up there right now. And how are you? Hi. Alright. Allison, you want to start? Yeah, he mentioned that you think the grouping is better now. Yeah, very good. Very good. Yeah, because it's yeah it it could either on base model I think. Oh, it sounds way too. Vectorised. Ann Yeah. Yeah, 10 seconds 10 seconds that both for the model that was 100 seconds. So. That And it doesn't seem to scale as badly as before, so it's even better. Yeah, it's very good. One of the things we're gonna have to check mark on that is how does that? Translate in different language in in maybe less European language please. So making sure does. That's a question I got yesterday on Lime as well. You know? How is Lime performing for non European language? Oh no, not latin language. Well, the grammar is quite different. And I was obviously unable to answer. Yeah. Yeah, it's a good question. Nobody is it. It's good so. So yeah. OK, cool. Asiri you want to go next. OK. OK cool can I ask you to move them? To the meeting to next week. Yeah anytime next week, but that will be helpful for today. OK, sorry to mess around with that. OK Ann Brian. They they, there is an echo, it's just me. I think it's Marc. Yeah. It's Marc. OK, Ann, that it's gonna be Marc. Yeah, just about. It's very much 'cause we need to ask to Microsoft unfortunately that you want to help. Yeah, but it's about. Where could be the area? Where, where security by myself to the problem. Yeah, just to say you know, even even you know, even LUIS might say, OK LUIS, it's it is our service on the cloud. But ultimately we can tend to get containerize it, and put it on your network? Like preempted? What we can preempt? And for the rest. Sad boy. Yeah. Yes. We don't know. So they said they would like to someone from Simi. Jim, but I yeah, I. OK. I'm on American Red Cross. Does anyone know? Where we are in terms of the development cycle, is it? Is it like a way in the last UAT? Because it seems for now we are going to be close to a month behind the original schedule to go live and I'm not hearing anything about going live. Do we know? Yeah. OK, OK, have they given us a target to go live. Well, not anymore. OK. OK, cool. Alright man OK. Is that everybody. Yeah, I think it's everybody. Nothing. OK cool cool cool. Then I don't think I have anything else today for me. It's a big day for you know what would we do? With investment money that I die if it comes so I'm really trying to close that. Might talk to you today on Monday about all the plan guys, but it's getting a bit of meat on the bone. OK. OK, speak to you later. Have a lovely day. Take care bye.
Brian_Edelman_2020_09_11_01_30_31_990.wav	Hey guys. She. Yeah. You need you need a trucker jacket as well. Ah. Pretty. I mean, it could be worse, it could be mm ah mm mm. I could probably guess what it is though. Yeah. This is. Yeah. Ha ha. Yeah, yeah. Yep. Right? Don't think I've ever tried to do that. Just. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'll take that. Bringing the heavies. Sure. So see ya, bye.
Brian_Edelman_2020_09_14_08_20_58_814.wav	Hi Alison. Yeah, I'm OK. Thanks you OK. Oh very. It's not that it's no, it's about to get really hot again, it's weird. This week's gonna. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's really weird. Hi Marc. Yep. Yeah, well. Go on then. Cool, um I can go next time? So James, he did a lot of stuff. American Red Cross on Friday, so it needs testing today. So that's very much what he can be doing. Definitely this morning it's gonna be testing. But then he got some sort. Tasks that he was gonna do last week, which he hadn't crossed over. There was very low crossover so it's probably best today so just just. Technical debt out on the. A Qbox and Fruut websites I have myself. This coming just Qbox today so more development is done now so it's gonna be many testing and fixing today. So... sprint. That's it. Quick, and easy meeting. For Monday morning. Yeah. Cool. Have a good day everyone. OK, catch you later.
Brian_Edelman_2020_09_16_08_20_28_890.wav	Hi Benoit. Yeah alright. What's the weather like where, where you are still hazy and cloudy is it nice over there? Oh yeah, yeah yes OK. Yeah, quite grey, grey blue. Yeah, it's it's kinda lot like here. No, yeah, that's nice. The. Yes. Yeah. And yeah, that. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. He's on holiday now. Yep, so James is on Fruut so he's got quite a lot of stuff to do. I also need to get stuff done this week. because he's off for the next few weeks and so he's got. He's got enough for all the work he needs to be doing and he's got enough. Should have enough done from Alex as well. You need in time for him to complete his stuff so he's working on that part. And obviously the part mark mentioned to do with the dialogues. Q Box I'm pretty much done now on. On the Sprint, so I've just got a little bit of testing to do and make sure we good for demo. I need to check in on Jogen he's doing a task for me at the moment just doing some technical debt on the QBox websites. He's got some time to do that we we wanted to do it for over a year now, so at least he's doing that today. I need to check on him on that 'cause its Slightly tricky task but yeah, no blockers really or anything untoward. Skype. Cool.
Joe_Cottrell_2020_09_11_01_31_24_265.wav	Yeah. It is. Hello. Its is is Paolo still at the hospital? No. He was getting a follow up X Ray from where his niece beat him up. Bryn is on holiday. Alex is. Somewhere. So how's everyone doing? We all happy? Finally got here. On time for an Italian. He Until Paolo puts his video and he's always on mute. The Italians can't talk without their hands, can they? Nice. Stop. Just in case you want think about your own mortality on a Friday. Yes. Yeah. I don't. It gets really goes really wrong. You escalate it to Apple. How big is your house? How big your house 'cause that saves a lot more time? I've got one of the East wing and then one in The West Wing as well. I'm gonna start I'm gonna stop you there Benoit I don't know it sounds awful I'm out. I don't know every time I think about changing my mind, I go talk to Lindsey about it and she very quickly dissuades me. The other. Guys we've only been doing it for five months guys you've not quite figured it out yet. Yeah. Oh Yeah. I like the idea. I like the idea of a baby reveal over a gender reveal though. There's a baby in a box. He did. The. Just. Cool. Yeah. That sounds like a man that want excuse to buy a new phone and was like oh if I do this, oh Joe, Sorry I've cleaned it and it's broken. I better go out tomorrow and get one. Ah. Yes. Predict the differences of phones technically worth something? Paolo technically isn't. Oh what? Fuck. Yeah. What about you Judith? How is your wedding stuff going? Oh yeah, I don't like wearing the satin dresses. You'll get married in the summer aren't you? So you'd want a light one surely? No. Never. Also, it gives you another 18 months to be really sure about it. Don't wanna rush into these things. Yes. Big. Even better. Awesome. What about rest of us? Do you need us to join it? Yeah. Take care. Right?
Judith_McConnell_2020_09_21_08_01_30_272.wav	Good morning. Sorry what did you say? If you go into dot dot dot device settings it should show what what devices team is using and you can do it. You can change them. If it's the Plantronics headphones, are they charged and switched on? That's usually the problem I have with them. Ah. You're a little bit quiet, but I can hear you. OK. Yeah, pretty good, quite quiet. That's nice. Oh yeah, rowing rowing is surprisingly hard work. Whereabouts in on the Thames did you go? That bit around the Thames around Marlow, is really pretty as well. I used to drive past there a lot. Ah. Yeah. That's kind of sad, I guess. Oh, hold on, I'm going to start team is recording as well just so I have more. More transcriptions to check. Sure, so we have the QBox regression testing this morning. Probably start on that once we're done with our meetings. And the upper take a decent chunk of the morning. And after that we have. Well, I have the the further attempts at reducing the word error rate that I'm going to be doing on the meetings models. I have more data from the managers meetings so I'm gonna add that, see how it goes. And I'm also going to try switching up the train test data set ratios since I don't have a lot of data that might just be I need to make the training set a bit smaller in the test set a bit bigger. And see how that performs. I don't know. I think I probably have enough to try adding the current amount and and seeing what happens. I'll still record the meeting this morning, but I don't need to worry about the transcription. But thank you though. Oh, and um, I just remembered yes, I'll be doing the weekly Lusy report with Seamus as well today. Nope. Cheers bye bye.
Judith_McConnell_2020_09_25_08_01_21_682.wav	Good morning. How we doing today? Yes. I am very excited about having a week off. Yeah. I think it's gonna be, I mean really it's not going to be amazing, but it's going to be late September October so it's going to be, you know, sort of like it is now. Probably cool, you know, sort of chilly, unsettled, but they'll be there. Will be, you know, sunny periods so. I'm sure we'll we'll see some decent ish weather. Yeah. Yeah, looking looking forward to it will be a nice change of pace, although I don't think there aren't any. Well lockdowns happened again I suppose, or sort of because when we do go down there during an actual holiday or bank holiday. Certainly, during the summer, it's very, very busy. 'cause you know, there's obviously a lot of people going camping and cycling and just driving through. There can be really tough because there's a because there's the horses that just walk into the road. And there's there's all the tourists who are just, you know, cycling everywhere. So. Ah yeah. Yeah, that sounds nice too to be honest. Was this the fancy new car for his work or? Is the fancy new car for his work or? Oh Oh dear is he OK. Yeah. That's good. What Car did you get? Oh well, that is fancy. Yeah, yeah. Oh basically, finishing up stuff before I go away so. I need to do some more transcriptions on the meetings we have today. Then I will try and workout what the current you know. It'll only be a small sample really, but I'll try and get an estimate on what the word error rate has been so far with the new version of the model. And so long as that seems vaguely sensible, hopefully we can continue with that. And also on the Fruutbot intents. It has been because we had to add the new summarize previous meeting. It's sometimes been getting that confused with book new meeting, not too much I did I did, you know, I did QBox around with it and try to distinguish them, but it still has happened a couple of times, so I'm going to take a look at that it if worst case scenario if it keeps being a problem then they'll just delete one of the intents for the purposes of the demo, but. Hopefully I can. I can make them work. And, um. So yeah, those those'll be the my try to main jobs for today. I've got a few other minor things like. Once I've, um, once I've got the New Fruut app bot set up on the live version, I strive retraining it again because there were some issues with Luis yesterday. And also, we're backing up all the old transcripts. They're taking up too much space, so I need to get in touch G and find out where all the backups should go. Just minor things, um? I guess so. I wanted to tell I wasn't sure whether um. I mean obviously, yeah. Yeah, you'll have to do the Lucy weekly report on Monday. I guess Alison. But if there is anything urgent they need to do with the, I mean, it's probably I think it I would do it. I don't know if you have the full access to the custom speech stuff and I don't know if Paolo would have time to sort it out, so maybe we can leave that, but I guess I can make sure your collaborator on the most recent versions of the Android and meeting Luis models for Fruut. Yeah, or at least. I don't think you have access to all of it. I'm not sure. I just remember it was an issue with getting it set up with Paolo before. I can ask in the meeting as well, um, if they if they want you to have access to it. In case you know, there is a huge problem. Butter. Well, I don't know if it'll if it will get set up in time or not, but I'll ask. Yeah, I'll make sure your collaborator on the two live models as well, in case there's anything they urgently need to change. Ah yes, we do. And also there's a Fruut demo of the last of the stuff that Alex did this morning. Means it's not anything. It's not anything that I worked on, but. Yeah, busy day. Yeah so is the summarization is that talking about what you've been doing, Seamus. OK. Alright. Wait and see. Yeah. Thought that was a little bit later today. I can't see. Oh yes, it's 11 or 11:30. Um again, if you could, maybe just do the um, perhaps this one. Once, once I've loaded in, then yeah, that would be good. I don't think I'll be able to get. I've been collecting, you know, a few of the meetings from yesterday. I'll be collecting ones today. I don't think I'll get all of them transcribed, but you know, just. I see a few of them is enough to at least get an initial test on the word error rate before I go. I do not know. I suppose they will continue with transcriptions anyway because you know, they probably want to test its performance. I think it's probably worthwhile trying to add a bit more data and seeing what happens, but if we add another round and it makes no difference and I think we may have reached reached the limit of what this model can do. So I guess again I'll ask in the stand up and See and see what they think. And I do not. I do because they're moving the data around. I actually do not know where they're currently gonna put them. Kalum will have access to them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. How's the? How's that going? The improvements on bee? Yes, I had. I notice that I was a bit annoyed 'cause I was. You know, I was like I I optimized bee. You know, if that's if it technically, you know wasn't actually as good as we thought it was, then OK. The LSTM? Yeah, the LSTM intents. I think I only added was it 1 two? Yeah I had I am. I had ideas for more but I didn't get round to adding them. I guess if you have to test it out, remember that there's there's a known issue where if you try to go crazy with the LSTM queries, it can often get confused when you're actually you know on bee itself. Yeah, I mean, I think I think it's probably. It's probably not an issue since I don't think they would normally. You know do that in a demo anyway. They just show up. Perhaps one of them, but. But yeah, if it's. Yeah. Nope. Yes, I'm really looking forward to it. Thank you. You guys have a good week. Alright thanks. Bye.
Marc_Wickens_2020_09_16_08_21_14_649.wav	Don't you have the staff doing it for you. Yeah. I. I think we should probably. It's a It's a client that's. It's like going to be a good. Good example for us if it's best as it could be, so it's probably worth it, I would say. You are. You saw that it was people. Are you thinking like a potential case study for QBox Benoit? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So from Pats, he's Pat's side. He's got a bit of work to do on BP. There's a few things coming up to do with email templates or something and also Intuit testing. From my side, just confirming with the Fruut team what stories they can do within the next week and also just adding in that story around opportunities that we discussed and kicking that project off for next week and also going to check in with James 'cause he's been looking at the dialogue and how it is going to make some recommendations about how we can just make it as concise as possible. Also need to test the app. I've got a new phone from Alex, he interesting. He the issue with it. Crashing on startup the Android app. I was getting it on my other phone and he having had the phone it in his hands he was able to fix it within like 15 minutes, so hopefully that's that's now fixed now. We won't see that anymore. Anne, and then on the Q Box side couple of small stuff. He I don't know, it was some just even just like I don't know how the app got into that state. I've never would have thought that would happen, but somehow it was so it was just some exception that was happening, but he never thought could happen I think. but Because I had it happening on the phone, 'cause obviously it happened. I guess by debugging it. Um? So yeah, it's just one of those things like it. Sometimes it is easier just to be in the same room. From the Q Box side so couple of small stories just to prepare for the story time about the we discussed yesterday basically and then looking at getting that API documentation written out much more nicely so we can show that to the clients. Ray is going to speak to Leanne about seeing where we are about what conversation we had in you know, making sure that's progressing and we can get something booked in and then also checking in with you and Halldor about the RASA issue. I guess we've all caught up on that Paulo, but I guess checking again later. See how you're getting on. Um? And yeah, couple of CV's and to look at that. That's it I think for today. Try hi instead of Hey. That's Great, I've actually started using Microsoft to do so. That should pull through being my task list. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that sounds reasonable. Yeah. OK, cool. That's it for me, I think, Yep. Yep. Yeah. It could we. Could we show the increase in size of model likes that how they're scaling the model, whether that's a? If that's a, That's a good stat whether they've got good numbers on it that might be. OK. Fair enough. OK. Sure. Nope. Yep. Thanks a lot, bye.
Marc_Wickens_2020_09_18_08_22_45_358.wav	So if it's not, then you've just gone in and spread it to everyone. Yeah. I forget. Yep. How much quicker? 20 seconds. Wow. Yeah, I good point yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I thought about that needs a little bit of thought. That's a good question. Yeah. OK, I did say to him to try and work with Alex to figure out that there must be a way of doing it, that's not going to take hours and hours just for the text formatting for example. But I can catch up with another. OK. Fair enough. No it's on my list Also, for me a few loose ends on the Q Box stories. I just need to get make sure everyone is in agreement with that, so I had to catch up with Leanne about whether to hide the SSO. Now she looked at the data and she's going to come back to me on that. Of whether to remove it, but I think in lieu of her she won't probably get back to me until next week. I'm just going to go with hiding it rather than removing it. So if if we if it is a problem, we can easily put it back in. Kind of like a soft remove. Also, they delivered it to UAT yesterday, so I need to just just quickly test a few of the stories. The project permissions ones give them a sanity check. And then on the Fruut side. So I did a lot of testing on the app yesterday I think will be good to release that. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than it was so. I think that's in a good place hasn't crashed or anything, and also testing the Fruutbot need to check that Kallum's What's delivered and what's testable, but to do some testing on that, and catch up with Alex about what he's proposing to make it more concise. On the on Fruut and Memo MRC Service is stopped working so Sati is going to try and Contact a few people to Microsoft to see if it can be. Restarted, or whatever's gone wrong there too. It's just some sort of maintenance thing 'cause the website still up, so hopefully they can fix that. And yeah preparing that. I've seen that thing about will on Monday, so Sati said that Martins after few questions or something. So I'm going to catch up with Sati about that as well. Yeah, OK yeah, try just to try and preempt their questions I guess. Yep. Yep. Do you know is it? Is it just Will or is it is there going to be any one more technical on the call? I can have a look. OK. OK. Oh yeah, and also just there's an issue on Zebra. Asked the question about QBox so I'm gonna look into that as well so I can get back to them. From earlier in the week? Yeah, that's it for me. Who's next. So. Yeah, that's the This is the final round of testing, but I believe that they also want to do load testing and they're waiting for you were going to request the increases on this from Microsoft or something on their infrastructure Paolo. I don't know if that's been done yet, but that was that was the blocker on the load testing. Yeah, so it's the final round of user testing, but there's also load testing to do, and then I think. That that's we can then go live I think. I don't have it in my head that I could probably check the project plan that Kim sent around, but I I don't know. Nice exciting. You too bye.
Marc_Wickens_2020_09_24_09_00_48_998.wav	Hi everyone. Did say you're in the office? Alex so? Oh, was it? 'cause it's at the maximum limit, yeah? Oh yeah, I think it's just it's like unless you it is kind of like don't go to the office unless you need to. I think I don't think it's like you have to. It's legal to go to the office. I think it's. If it's gonna impact your job or something, I'm pretty sure I mean, obviously I'm not. Not legal advisor, so Fruut for loop Fruut. Delete the last sentence in case Alex tries to Sue me. We need to add that actually like shit. I don't want that to be on tape. Can you delete that? Yeah, I was gonna go in but I kind of. I've got something at 6:00 o'clock today. I wanted to get away for an also for work. If the cases are going not probably best to sort of stay away so. Ah yeah, I didn't look to be honest stop looking. Wow. Have any of you installed the new app was released today? The Covid app that they track and trace? I've installed it. It seems pretty well done, I mean, but it's basically using the underlying Google and Apple APIs. How? I just NHS. Covid, I think it will be. It's like #2 in the top download chart, so you'll find it quickly. But I'm if you got a decent recent or other decent phone then it will. It will be. Built into the operating system, it says all it's doing is really when is is sort of triggering the alert versus the most of the code it just running is or is already part of the Bluetooth Stack that's in the operating system. Sure, it's quite a cool idea. Oh cool. But Alright, so you can put antiques, antibody testing and I thought there's obviously there's the. There's a test for actually have you currently got covid? And then there's test for have you ever had it in the past? And you can put both in, can you? OK cool yeah, although there is. I'll just say there is a lot of growing. I think consensus that, but maybe not consensus, but concerns that the antibody test is only looking at one part of the immune system. It's not looking at another part that could be affected, so it could actually more people are immune than we thought. Stop. Right? Yeah. Yes, only time really when negative is a good thing is when you having a sort of medical test. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Testing interesting times? Well, let's get something that we can control. I guess is the apps we can. We can make good apps. I. Cool, looking forward to testing that. Do you? Do you want us to sort of test it before the demo or after tomorrow? Yep. All the noise yeah, oh cool that we can. We can we trust test that now. So if I say hey, fruut, take me to the Moon. Wow. Oh I see, yeah, the idea was just to play the noise instead of saying sorry, blah blah blah just to make it more quick quickly. You can just quickly try again, basically. But I. Anyone want to look for another sound that one sounds like? I've just been shot in like I don't know. Like with duty or something. Hey Fruut, tell me my future fortune. Oh no, it's. Alright. Yeah someone. OK well. Sati, maybe if you could have you got the list of the files from James and you were maybe you could pick out one that's a little bit. The Fit more with the durdum. If we got a durdum. Oh, great nice. OK, So what the same? The same thing that Microsoft exact same thing. Or is it like an alternative? Method. Yeah, that would be good. OK cool. Awesome. So I had a look at the the manager meeting transcript today and I only read the first sort of three or four paragraphs, but it did seem much better in terms of I don't know if it's a placebo effect 'cause I know it's been retrained or or not, but. It does look a lot better. It's just that it's got used to our really lacks way of pronouncing things. It seems to definitely be an improvement, which is really cool. Judith, did you wanna? Add anything. Yeah, for some reason the bot just left the call after we hadn't really started, so it wasn't really an issue, but I don't know why. Maybe Kalum you doing a delivery or something. This morning yeah, then, if you it was the meeting that starts at 20 past nine, it was. I joined about 5 minutes late and yet they hadn't started. They were still waiting for benoit to join and then just after I joined it just like left. Um, then I just added It again and it's it was fine. It stayed to the end so I'm not sure what happened there. Sorry. No, that we were on the call like it was me, Brian Alison, Paolo. So yeah, we, I wonder whether there's been problems with teams today because I don't know if any of you guys have been kicked off, but we had a meeting earlier you were on it weren't you? Sati and we all just got kicked off and then it said the call has dropped and then we all just joined again and it was fine. So I don't know. It might just be saying what? Going on with weird with teams. Oh so my plan today is to do a bit of testing with the bot, so I'll see if I if it happens again. If that sort of thing does happen do you? Are you capturing sort of exception logs or anything just so we can sort of get to the bottom of it? Yeah, that might be good 'cause. Cool OK. OK, and the intents are they they little bit more fleshed out now as well. Cool. OK. OK, cool. Well, I think so. There's two things that we can't do on zoom that we can on on teams. So the first is. Get an is unique audio stream for each user. So attributing the text to the right person. There are ways to do that using machine learning, but it's I think they're they're highly variable and how good they are, and some of them require you to identify yourself at the beginning, like hi I'm Marc, hi I'm Sati, etc. And they have there's usually limits as well on how many people you can have. And as we've seen there not. It's not that reliable, so that's one option. But then the other thing is we can't write back to the audio stream either, so you can't have any audio feedback, so you can't ask your question. Or if you did, it would have to be texting you it somehow, so it's. It gets to a point where we think is it worth doing so I'm thinking is, it worth doing. 'cause it would be so limited. 'cause they're their use case for getting an audio stream is meant for. Like if you wanted to broadcast a zoom meeting to Facebook live or something, or to YouTube, you know to have it so you can have like hundreds of thousands of people watching your zoom meeting. That's that's what it's meant for. It's not meant for our use case, so I even just how you set it off isn't very clean either. So I think I don't think it's worth trying it. I think maybe the next step might be to ask to sort of ask zoom if they've got any plans to rollout. Could be a beta tester, but I wanted to speak to Benoit about that. Whether there could be anyone on the HSBC side that kind of help us with that. If it 'cause if HSBC really are one of our biggest customers, which they are? I think so. I think that's what will said, wasn't it? And then they might might be led by their, you know what they've asked. You know if HSBC, say we really want to be able to do this. Could you work with volume? That might be really powerful. So one I think once we've shown the teams app. If they like it and they buy into it, that's what I think you might they are. I'm thinking then they we might be able to get in contact with someone at zoom via HSBC to say, can we? How do we make this work on zoom? But that's what I'm thinking. We need to talk through with Bneoit, I think but. I think as it stands, I think the app wouldn't be that useful. Wouldn't be that impressive? Cheers everyone. Catch you later bye.
Paolo_Rossi_2020_09_09_08_20_43_797.wav	I think so. It's a bit silly, because what's the difference if you meet outside or if you meet in the office? The virus is not looking if you are working or if you are having fun. I don't know. It sounds a bit weird. Yeah, yeah, probably you're right. I don't know if it. Hey. Yep. I think so. If I remember, well, yeah. For the small disambiguation tweaks, no, we don't need this. Just one additional step. I remember we talked yesterday about one change that we need to discuss, but I don't remember now what was the change? I will catch up with you later, but I'm already doing their small tweaks for the disambiguation, so I need to check with you some small things but nothing major. Shouldn't be that much work. Yep, Yep Yep, sure. We lost you, yeah. OK, probably teams is gone. Cool. I go next in the Oh no, we have Brian back. No problem mate. Hey Benoit. Yep. I go, I can go next if you want. OK, Tanya is going on with BP. She's moving on with the sprint with no blockers on this side. The same for Halldor is going on with QBox. The normal sprint no blockers and they both have enough workload to cover all the week. Sorry Kalum and Alex. They are going on with Fruut, new features and stability fixes and they are starting also the handover about a mobile app I discussed with Alex and he will focus on the same most specific piece of code. I mean not the generic Android structure because this is quite known to Kalum. and is not that difficult so you will focus mainly on the. Things that are specific to Fruut and Memo on my side I'm working on American Red Cross fixes and adding disambiguation after the last round of tests. I'm moving on with those tasks and no blockers on this side. I'm doing also some support. Yep. Yes. Because they asked us some changes. Adding disambiguation for some dialogues, nothing major, but a list of small tweaks. Uh huh. Yeah sure. Uh huh. Uh huh. Not really, I'm thinking, and I'm looking out to the mailbox. But no, not that I remember. OK. Yeah, sure. Uh huh. Very good. OK, I will have a look to the. At those videos and documentation. OK good sorry I was saying OK, American Red Cross. I'm doing a bit of support for QBbox. We need to update the users for Vodafone now that they have been invited for this part Marc I saw your email earlier. To me and Ray. Shall I go? Shall I go on and update the users manually, because this is the only solution we have right now? Ah, OK. OK. Uh huh. OK, makes sense to me, so I'm going on with the day to fix and then I will lead the discussion about communication to you Ray, and Leanne OK? Cool OK other thing I'm also going on with the security review becausw I notice new security assessment available on Azure about different databases so I'm having a look and see what we can say fix quickly or what we should mark as something to look after because we're having more and more requests about security. Our application, so I thought that this can be a good activity to to carry on. We had another second interview yesterday. Benoit I will need to catch up with you about the two candidates we saw on Monday and yesterday, and I will have another in a first interview. In this case later today. Let me know Benoit when you have. A bit of time to catch up about the candidates and also about the other message you sent on teams. That's all from me. Is he gone? Ah, OK. OK fine, aI will catch up with him directly. The earlier message, yes. They want about yes Bell Canada and their api. OK, I think that's also. Me too, I'm thinking to go to the office, but now I'm waiting for a call from the GP because I need to follow up with my right hand and so depends because if we will book the appointment for tomorrow no I will not be in the office. No, Joe is back tomorrow. And you take care, speak to you later. Bye.
Paolo_Rossi_2020_09_11_08_22_45_952.wav	Yeah. Good. No. ******* what? Why, Monday why Monday? Really, why? Yeah. Ah, OK. Yeah. Cool, so I was looking at the different projects, no blockers on QBox, no blockers. Also on BP I took a check with the guys to to check with the workload but it should be fine. Kallum and Alex. They are going on with the development of Fruut and bug fixing an also hand over. So Alex started doing sessions with Kallum in order to to pass the knowledge about the mobile application on my side. I'm still working on small amends for American Red Cross. Nothing major, just minor changes and then we should be able to publish a newer version for them to test. I started working also on the RASA virtual machine for Bell Canada, so I'm looking at the Web Server used to expose the API. If there's any way to tweak it and make it more stable, more reliable. Otherwise, I have I'm looking also for other solution I asked also on the RASA forum, so let's see if we get any answer. From people in the same forum. I just received a good news from Amy and Alex, the developer. We made an offer finally accepted so we will have a new developer starting soon. I mean is in one month notice, so ideally for October. More or less an, that's that's good. That's a good news. I got two other interviews today. First interviews this time, so quite a busy day for the recruitment part. I think that's still that's all on the side. I was going on doing a bit of maintenance on Azure, both for security and cost management, mainly security because there are new security assessment available for the different databases. So now they're going a bit more in deep with security checks and I want to be up to date. One last thing I will work on these probably from Monday or anyway. Next week I started looking at the new version of the bot framework and the bot framework composer you wanted share with me seems interesting. I have to understand a bit better pros and cons. One thing that I notice immediately is that most of the concepts they added or they introduced with this newer version, are concepts that we were already using on BBC. For example answer variation. They have a strange system called trigger, an action that reminds me something we wrote last year or more than that. It seems interesting and it seems overall a complete framework for dialogue building, but also sort of CMS so. I want to understand. Also where's the overlapping, what they're doing better, what we are still doing better, or how can we merge the two frameworks, let's say? So I will start having a look. I already started just reading the intro tutorials. I will look a bit more in deep next week. And that's all from me. Yeah. Yes, there is still a manual process, so the first time they need to log in with Active Directory so we can catch the active directory and then I can fix manually. So yesterday I fixed for another user and I'm keeping I'm keeping. I'm going on checking from time to time if there are new users log I cannot. I can fix manually. Who's next? OK, good. Yeah, the template to the arm template. Uh. Not really, because because they did the initial setup. Sorry I forgot this. OK, I'm looking but I cannot find the email. Oh OK. Anyway, I take note of user. OK, let me have a look because they created environment and then I just did configuration or you know settings. No. No, they prefer to go step by step, creating them manually. OK, let me have a look and then we can group based on that if you for any chance can find email please forward to me. Yes please. I'm searching as well. Yes. Oh Gosh. Speak to you guys. Take care.

I guess the demo is purely just see want see what you've done, obviously. over the sort of development period. But yeah, I guess in terms of doing a release, I mean by there so by end of play tomorrow or first thing on Monday that would be good. Yeah. OK cool, um was an an I guess with any sort of potential issues that you've you're facing. Or is it all good? Alright, cool. No. Yeah. Yeah Alright Cool Awesome Alright cool. I mean, this is just moving onto the bot then so Kalum are we sort of caught up yesterday afternoon. See I mean how you getting on with the with the bot. Yeah. Background. Hey. So yeah. Ann Yeah. Yeah, just send me the list of files and I'll have a look or just see if there's anything else I will find. Yeah have a look. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I played around with it this morning and it does seem to be better, but that's all. Ah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, it's a stretch task. Ok. Cool, um? OK, Marc, this quick question on the on the zoom stuff if they if they can't if they're not able to sort separate audio streams, what the alternative will be able to follow? Yeah, yeah. Early. Yeah. OK. Cool. Alright, um, was there anything from anyone else? Oh, actually there was one more thing. Goodbye, I'm basically I've logged one or two. Bugs that I found. As I said, I tagged you on those. It's just when you. Um? When you assign an action to yourself, when you say action for me, sometimes it just says all you know it doesn't give you the opportunity to sort of record the action. So I put some examples in there so just just try and sort of have ago with it. So if still action for me or when it's action for me it just sorta start speaking itself and saying, well, you know you don't provide enough information. Um whereas if you say the action for Marc or action for Alex, it seems to work OK. This is have a look at at. Um, yeah. And and the other thing as well the The Fruut logo still doesn't appear for me. It also shows that blue, so icon. So yes, have a look at that as well, but I'm going to do some further testing this morning and just yes, he is. If there's anything else, I'll let you know. Cool. Alright, awesome thanks everyone. Have a good day. Yes, bye.
